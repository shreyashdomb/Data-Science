    "\n",
    "Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework and does not have any dependencies on external libraries or tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to Use: Flask is easy to learn and use, making it a popular choice for beginners in web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask is highly flexible and can be customized to fit specific project requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask provides a wide range of extensions that can be easily integrated into the framework, allowing developers to add more functionality to their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Flask is highly scalable and can be used to build small as well as large-scale applications.\n",

    "App routes are also used to handle HTTP requests made by the user's browser.
