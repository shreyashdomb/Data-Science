    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of that data. Databases are used to store large amounts of data for various applications such as web applications, enterprise systems, and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two types of database management systems with different approaches to organizing and managing data. Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases use a tabular or relational data model, where data is stored in tables with predefined columns and rows. NoSQL databases use a non-tabular or non-relational data model, where data is stored in collections or documents with flexible structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning that they can handle increased load by adding more resources to a single server. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning that they can handle increased load by adding more servers to a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: SQL databases use SQL to query and manipulate data, which is a standardized language for relational databases. NoSQL databases use various query languages depending on the type of database, such as JavaScript for MongoDB and Cassandra Query Language for Cassandra.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Compliance: SQL databases are ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, meaning that they ensure data integrity and consistency even in the event of system failures. NoSQL databases are generally not fully ACID compliant and sacrifice some degree of consistency in favor of scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: SQL databases are commonly used for applications that require complex querying and transactional consistency, such as banking systems and inventory management. NoSQL databases are commonly used for applications that require high scalability and performance, such as social networks and real-time analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are the data model, scalability, query language, ACID compliance, and use cases. The choice of which database to use depends on the specific needs and requirements of the application.\n",

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL commands are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations of some commonly used DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and stored procedures. For example, to create a new table called \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary, we could use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP: The DROP command is used to remove database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. For example, to drop the \"employees\" table that we created above, we could use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of existing database objects such as tables and indexes. For example, to add a new column called \"department\" to the \"employees\" table that we created above, we could use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all data from a table while keeping the structure of the table intact. For example, to remove all data from the \"employees\" table that we created above, we could use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2.UPDATE: The UPDATE command is used to modify existing data in a table. For example, to update the salary of an employee with the employee ID of 1 in the \"employees\" table, we could use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE employees SET salary = 60000 WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "This command will update the salary of the employee with the employee ID of 1 to 60000 in the \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",

    "SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;\n",

The primary key is used to enforce data integrity and ensure that each record in the table is unique. The primary key is also used as a reference point by other tables that have a relationship with the table that contains the primary key. For example, in a table called \"employees,\" the employee ID column could be the primary key because each employee has a unique employee ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. The foreign key is used to establish a relationship between two tables, and it ensures that the data in both tables is consistent. For example, in a table called \"orders,\" a column called \"customer_id\" could be a foreign key that references the primary key of the \"customers\" table. This relationship ensures that each order in the \"orders\" table is associated with a valid customer in the \"customers\" table.\n",
