    "Class and Object are fundamental concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "A Class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). Classes define a new data type and encapsulate data and behavior in a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object is an instance of a Class. It is a real-world entity, and represents a single instance of the Class. An object has state (values assigned to attributes) and behavior (methods that operate on that state).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the Class Car. A Class Car could have attributes such as make, model, year, and speed. It could also have methods such as accelerate, brake, and get_speed. An object created from the Class Car would represent a single instance of a car, such as a 2019 Honda Civic. The object would have its own values for the attributes, such as make = \"Honda\", model = \"Civic\", year = 2019, and speed = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Class provides a blueprint for creating objects and defines the attributes and behavior that objects of the Class will have. An Object is a single instance of a Class, representing a real-world entity and having its own attributes and behavior."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and the functions operating on the data within a single unit or object. It provides the means of abstraction and is used to hide the implementation details from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object to the outside world. It helps to reduce the complexity of the system and make it more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism of deriving a new class from an existing class. The new class inherits all the attributes and behaviors of the existing class, and can also have its own attributes and behaviors. This allows for a clear relationship between classes and helps to promote code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class, making it possible to write generic and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars work together to support the fundamental principles of OOP, including encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, and allow developers to design flexible, scalable, and maintainable software systems."
